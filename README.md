# Android Maze Game

This was a project completed as a part of the CS301 Software Development course, taught by Peter Kemper at the College of William & Mary in Fall 2019.

The semester-long project started with a sizable, working codebase for a maze game, to which I iteratively added more features (like maze generation algorithms, maze-solving AIs, user interfaces). This culminated with an effort to port the Java codebase to Android, reworking the user interfaces to suit a mobile environment.
